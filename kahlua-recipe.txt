Ingredients:

 -10 oz coffee (by weight), either plain or flavored (the more robust the coffee, the better the Kahlua will be)
  about 8 c water
 -7 c sugar
 -1.75 L vodka (don't waste money on good vodka: worse vodka makes better kahlua)
 -1 whole vanilla bean

Directions:
1. Use the water to brew the coffee. (Depending on your coffee maker, this will take a few batches.)

2. Pour the sugar into a large empty pot.

3. Use the hot coffee to dissolve the sugar. Turn on the flame for a minute to make sure everything dissolves.

4. Cool to lukewarm.

5. Add vodka.

6. Pour into a gallon jar.

7. Add the vanilla bean.

8. Leave in refrigerator one week, shaking daily (or as you remember).

Store indefinitely at room temperature.
